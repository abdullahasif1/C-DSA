Heap- A complete BST with heap properties implemented
    - All levels are completely filled except the last level
Insertion -O(logN)
Deletion  -O(logN)
Hwapify   -O(NlogN)
HeapSort  -O(NlogN)

Max-Heap = every root node is greater than its right and left subtree

Min-Heap = every root node is lesser than its right and left subtree
